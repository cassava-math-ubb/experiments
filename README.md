What are we trying to do atm:
  - Data Analysis: 
    - [x] similarity with some Monte Carlo simulations (https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03924)
    - [ ] color space (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187770581100021X)
    - [ ] blurriness
    - [x] denoising filters
  - [ ] EfficientNet
  - [ ] ViT (?)
